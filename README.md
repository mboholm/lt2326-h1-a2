# lt2326-h1-a2

Assignment 2, LT2326, autumn 2021.
Name: Max Boholm.
Besides this README file, this repository contains:

*    `bonus_part.md`, description and discussison of the bonus part. The code for the bonus part is in `part2.ipynb`.
*    `original.ipynb`, the original file, from which `part1.ipynb` and `part2.ipynb` have been developed. **This can be ignored.**
*    `part1.ipynb`, the code and comments for part 1 of the assignment.
*    `part2.ipynb`, the code and comments for part 2 of the assignment.

A note on development of this: I first developed the code for Part 2 and the bonus (`part2.ipynb`), and then I removed everything not relevant for part 1 in`part1.ipynb`.
